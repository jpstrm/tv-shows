### Questions

- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
    - I decided use React with Redux because it's more flexible to control states. Axios to make HTTP calls, Flexbox
    to control the grid and rows. 
    
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
    - Yes, I'll add Pagination, Details Pages, Join Shows with Movies, Responsive page.
 
- What would you do differently if you had more time?
    - Change from angular where I have more experience
    - I'll planned better before starting the development and study more about React
